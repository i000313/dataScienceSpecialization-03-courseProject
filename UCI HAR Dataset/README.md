The dataset to be processed must be put inside this directory. For that:

1. Download the dataset from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip ;
2. Unzip the downloaded file;

After that the directory should have the following structure:

```
\UCI HAR Dataset

		\Inertial Signals (directory with 9 *.txt files)
		subject_test.txt
		X_test.txt
		y_test.txt
	\train
		\Inertial Signals (directory with 9 *.txt files)
		subject_train.txt
		X_train.txt
		y_train.txt
	activity_labels.txt
	features.txt
	features_info.txt
	README.txt
```
